        <h1>10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</h1>
   
		<p> <br>
		  Summary: Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction
		  design. They are called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of
		  thumb and not specific usability guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>&nbsp; <br>
		  <em>By Jakob Nielsen on Apr. 24, 1994; Updated Nov. 15, 2020</em> </p>
<h2>#1: Visibility of system status</h2>
    <p>The design should always keep users informed about what is going on,
        through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

        <br />When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome
        of their prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable
        interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand.
</p> 
        <h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #1: </h4> 
		You Are Here indicators on mall maps show people where they currently are, to help them understand where
        to go next.


    <h2>#2: Match between system and the real world</h2>
       <p>The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and
        concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow
        real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and
        logical order. The way you should design depends very much on your
        specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly
        clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your
        users. When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and
        correspond to desired outcomes (called natural mapping), it’s easier for
        users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build
        an experience that feels intuitive.</p> 

        <h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #2:</h4>

        When stovetop controls match the layout of heating elements, users
        can quickly understand which control maps to which heating element.


    <h2>#3: User control and freedom</h2>

       <p>Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked
        "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go
        through an extended process. When it's easy for people to back out of a
        process or undo an action, it fosters a sense of freedom and confidence.
        Exits allow users to remain in control of the system and avoid getting
        stuck and feeling frustrated.</p> 
		<h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #3:</h4>
        Digital spaces need quick emergency exits, just like physical spaces do.

		
    <h2>#4: Consistency and standards</h2>
       <p>Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or
        actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.
        Jakob's Law states that people spend most of their time using digital
        products other than yours. Users’ experiences with those other products
        set their expectations. Failing to maintain consistency may increase the
        users' cognitive load by forcing them to learn something new.</p>  
		
		<h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #4:</h4> 
		Checkin counters are usually located at the front of hotels. This consistency meets
        customers’ expectations.
        
    <h2>#5: Error prevention</h2>
       <p>Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully
        prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate
        error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a
        confirmation option before they commit to the action. There are two
        types of errors: slips and mistakes. Slips are unconscious errors caused
        by inattention. Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch
        between the user’s mental model and the design.</p>  
        <h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #5:</h4> 
		​​​​Guard rails on curvy mountain
        roads prevent drivers from falling off cliffs.
        

    <h2>#6: Recognition rather than recall</h2>
        <p>
			<br />Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and
        options visible. The user should not have to remember information from
        one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the
        design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily
        retrievable when needed.

        <br />Humans have limited short-term memories. Interfaces that promote
        recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users.

        </p>
		
		<h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #6:</h4>
        It’s easier for most people to recognize the capitals of
        countries, instead of having to remember them. People are more likely to
        correctly answer the question Is Lisbon the capital of Portugal? rather
        than What’s the capital of Portugal?

    <h2>#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use</h2>
       <p>Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for
        the expert user so that the design can cater to both inexperienced and
        experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions. Flexible
        processes can be carried out in different ways, so that people can pick
        whichever method works for them.</p>  
		<h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #7:</h4>
		Regular routes are listed on maps, but locals with knowledge of the area can take shortcuts.
        
    <h2>#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
       <p>Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely
        needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with
        the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative
        visibility. This heuristic doesn't mean you have to use a flat design —
        it's about making sure you're keeping the content and visual design
        focused on the essentials. Ensure that the visual elements of the
        interface support the user's primary goals.</p>  
		
		<h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #8:</h4>
       	An ornate teapot may have excessive decorative elements, like an
        uncomfortable handle or hard-to-wash nozzle, that can interfere with
        usability.
       
    <h2>#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
       <p>Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes),
        precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.
        These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments
        that will help users notice and recognize them.</p> 
		
		<h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #9:</h4> 
		Wrong way signs on the road remind drivers that they are heading in the wrong direction
        and ask them to stop.
        
    <h2>#10: Help and documentation</h2>
        <p>It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation.
        However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users
        understand how to complete their tasks. Help and documentation content
        should be easy to search and focused on the user's task. Keep it
        concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out. </p>
		<h4>Example of Usability Heuristic #10:</h4> 
		Information kiosks at airports are easily recognizable and solve customers’ problems in context and immediately.
        
    <h3>Note from Jakob</h3>
       <p>
	     <br />I originally developed the heuristics for heuristic evaluation in
        collaboration with Rolf Molich in 1990 [Molich and Nielsen 1990; Nielsen
        and Molich 1990]. Four years later, I refined the heuristics based on a
        factor analysis of 249 usability problems [Nielsen 1994a] to derive a
        set of heuristics with maximum explanatory power, resulting in this
        revised set of heuristics [Nielsen 1994b].

        <br />In 2020, we updated this article, adding more explanation,
        examples, and related links. While we slightly refined the language of
        the definitions, the 10 heuristics themselves have remained relevant and
        unchanged since 1994. When something has remained true for 26 years, it
        will likely apply to future generations of user interfaces as well.
